<i>The Future of Secure and Immutable Contract</i>

</div>

## Background

Our product is built based on this issue:

> The Supreme Court (Mahkamah Agung) adjudicated 2.283 cases in total involving breach of contract (wanprestasi) [https://putusan3.mahkamahagung.go.id]. Wanprestasi leads by some major causes, such as poorly organized contracts, unethical individuals, and corrupt practices (Wagiu et al., 2023).

## What We Offer?

Introducing PactLock, an innovative Web 3.0 solution that leverages blockchain technology to provide a secure and immutable place for contract discussions, storages, and managements. Our product utilizes decentralized storage so that all contracts are permanently archived and accessible only to authorized parties, ensuring transparency and security. We guarantee the integrity, permanence, and security of all digital agreements by harnessing blockchainâ€™s trustless infrastructure for contract-making and management into a more transparent and efficient process.

## Main Features

- **Secure Contract Meetings:** A blockchain-powered meeting space for discussing contracts with a verifiable digital trail.

* **Immutable Contract Archiving:** Decentralized storage ensures contracts remain permanent, tamper-proof, and accessible only to authorized parties.
